# NFL-Spreads-Analysis

In this project, I conducted an analysis on NFL point spreads and total lines. Using Python to conduct an exploratory analysis, linear regression, and clustering of NFL games and their associated betting lines from 2016-2023. Presented here is my scripts and presentation summarizing my findings.


## Key Objectives

Are the spreads set by oddsmakers a good predictive tool to predict the outcomes of games?

What are the home/away win rates?

What are the home/away cover rates? 

What are the home/away cover rates when favored?

What are the home/away win rates during primetime games?

What are the home/away cover rates when favored during primetime?
